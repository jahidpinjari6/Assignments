    "    An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's execution. \n",
    "    Exceptions can be caused by a variety of things, such as invalid input, accessing a nonexistent object, or dividing by zero.\n",

    "    When an exception occurs, the Python interpreter stops executing the current line of code and raises an exception object. \n",

    "    and a message describing the exception.\n",
